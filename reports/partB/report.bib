	abstract = {In this paper we present {TDLeaf}(lambda), a variation on the {TD}(lambda) algorithm that enables it to be used in conjunction with minimax search. We present some experiments in both chess and backgammon which demonstrate its utility and provide comparisons with {TD}(lambda) and another less radical variant, {TD}-directed(lambda). In particular, our chess program, ``{KnightCap},'' used {TDLeaf}(lambda) to learn its evaluation function while playing on the Free Internet Chess Server ({FICS}, fics.onenet.net). It improved from a 1650 rating to a 2100 rating in just 308 games. We discuss some of the reasons for this success and the relationship between our results and Tesauro's results in backgammon.},
